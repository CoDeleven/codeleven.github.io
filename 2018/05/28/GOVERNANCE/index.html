        <h3 id="Streams-Working-Group"><a href="#Streams-Working-Group" class="headerlink" title="Streams Working Group"></a>Streams Working Group</h3><p>The Node.js Streams is jointly governed by a Working Group<br>(WG)<br>that is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.</p>
<p>The WG has final authority over this project including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical direction</li>
<li>Project governance and process (including this policy)</li>
<li>Contribution policy</li>
<li>GitHub repository hosting</li>
<li>Conduct guidelines</li>
<li>Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators</li>
</ul>
<p>For the current list of WG members, see the project<br><a href="./README.md#current-project-team-members">README.md</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Collaborators"><a href="#Collaborators" class="headerlink" title="Collaborators"></a>Collaborators</h3><p>The readable-stream GitHub repository is<br>maintained by the WG and additional Collaborators who are added by the<br>WG on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made<br>Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These<br>individuals are identified by the WG and their addition as<br>Collaborators is discussed during the WG meeting.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> If you make a significant contribution and are not considered<br>for commit-access log an issue or contact a WG member directly and it<br>will be brought up in the next WG meeting.</p>
<p>Modifications of the contents of the readable-stream repository are<br>made on<br>a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a<br>modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project<br>Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a<br>Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full<br>responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed<br>by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required<br>for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators<br>participate and there is disagreement around a particular<br>modification. See <em>Consensus Seeking Process</em> below for further detail<br>on the consensus model used for governance.</p>
<p>Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial<br>modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to the<br>WG for discussion by assigning the <strong><em>WG-agenda</em></strong> tag to a pull<br>request or issue. The WG should serve as the final arbiter where<br>required.</p>
<p>For the current list of Collaborators, see the project<br><a href="./README.md#members">README.md</a>.</p>
<h3 id="WG-Membership"><a href="#WG-Membership" class="headerlink" title="WG Membership"></a>WG Membership</h3><p>WG seats are not time-limited.  There is no fixed size of the WG.<br>However, the expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequate<br>coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to<br>make decisions efficiently.</p>
<p>There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for WG<br>membership beyond these rules.</p>
<p>The WG may add additional members to the WG by unanimous consensus.</p>
<p>A WG member may be removed from the WG by voluntary resignation, or by<br>unanimous consensus of all other WG members.</p>
<p>Changes to WG membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be<br>suggested as any other agenda item (see “WG Meetings” below).</p>
<p>If an addition or removal is proposed during a meeting, and the full<br>WG is not in attendance to participate, then the addition or removal<br>is added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting.  This is to ensure<br>that all members are given the opportunity to participate in all<br>membership decisions.  If a WG member is unable to attend a meeting<br>where a planned membership decision is being made, then their consent<br>is assumed.</p>
<p>No more than 1/3 of the WG members may be affiliated with the same<br>employer.  If removal or resignation of a WG member, or a change of<br>employment by a WG member, creates a situation where more than 1/3 of<br>the WG membership shares an employer, then the situation must be<br>immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more WG<br>members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).</p>
<h3 id="WG-Meetings"><a href="#WG-Meetings" class="headerlink" title="WG Meetings"></a>WG Meetings</h3><p>The WG meets occasionally on a Google Hangout On Air. A designated moderator<br>approved by the WG runs the meeting. Each meeting should be<br>published to YouTube.</p>
<p>Items are added to the WG agenda that are considered contentious or<br>are modifications of governance, contribution policy, WG membership,<br>or release process.</p>
<p>The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;<br>that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger<br>group of Collaborators.</p>
<p>Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to<br>the next meeting’s agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,<br>WG member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding<br>the <strong><em>WG-agenda</em></strong> tag to the issue.</p>
<p>Prior to each WG meeting the moderator will share the Agenda with<br>members of the WG. WG members can add any items they like to the<br>agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the WG<br>cannot veto or remove items.</p>
<p>The WG may invite persons or representatives from certain projects to<br>participate in a non-voting capacity.</p>
<p>The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each<br>agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="Consensus-Seeking-Process"><a href="#Consensus-Seeking-Process" class="headerlink" title="Consensus Seeking Process"></a>Consensus Seeking Process</h3><p>The WG follows a<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consensus<br>Seeking</a><br>decision-making model.</p>
<p>When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator<br>will ask “Does anyone object?” as a final call for dissent from the<br>consensus.</p>
<p>If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a WG member can call for<br>either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next<br>meeting. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the WG<br>or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.</p>
<p>Note that changes to WG membership require a majority consensus.  See<br>“WG Membership” above.</p>
